    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>FPSFrenzy has been a cornerstone for my journey so far. <br></p>
<p>One, this project was my first time developing a first-person shooter.
Second, this was also my first time implementing online networking into a game.
For such big feats, this was a pretty difficult project to tackle. But I'm proud of what I've accomplished.<br></p>
<p>At first, the idea was to create a simple first-person shooter, with low poly textures, shooting at AI.
However, I wanted to go bigger since I've worked on AI already. So I decided to implement an online multiplayer feature.<br></p>
<img src="/imgs/projects/fpsfrenzy/fpsfrenzy-combat.png" alt="FPSFrenzy User Aiming at Another Player">
<p>Players can join a lobby and play against each other. Initially, for 1v1-type scenarios.
Each player can choose between 3 weapons: a pistol, a submachine gun, and a sniper rifle.
A player wins by getting the most amount of kills before the timer runs out. <br></p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        
            <h4>Online Networking</h4>
            <p>
  FPSFrenzy was my first real dive into online multiplayer,
  and let me tell you it was equally rewarding and frustrating.<br><br>

  For this project, I worked with Photon, a networking tool that’s pretty
  beginner-friendly but still packed with complexities when it comes to real-time multiplayer.
  From synchronizing player movements to managing game states,
  Photon helped me handle a lot of the heavy lifting,
  but it still required plenty of fine-tuning to get things just right.<br><br>

  One of the biggest challenges was syncing animations and player movement across the network.
  <strong>It’s not just about sending data; it’s about sending the right data at the right time</strong>.<br><br>

  For example, player positions needed frequent updates to look smooth for other players,
  but not so frequent that it bogged down the network.
  I spent hours tweaking this balance and designing a protocol to prioritize critical actions
  like shooting, jumping, or switching weapons, while cutting back on non-essential updates.<br><br>

  Another tricky part was making sure all players saw the same UI elements
  in real time—like scores, timers, and lobby data.
  Even something as simple as displaying a player’s name or a server title involved precise timing.
  The solution?
  I carefully structured when and how this data was sent:
  typically when a match started, a player joined, or a significant event occurred.
  It sounds simple, but ensuring all players saw the same
  thing without delays was a constant test of patience and attention to detail.<br><br>

  Implementing these systems taught me a lot about the complexities of real-time networking
  and the importance of optimizing data flow to maintain a seamless multiplayer experience.
  Photon’s tools were incredibly helpful for these tasks,
  but the process also emphasized the need for custom solutions
  tailored to specific game mechanics and player expectations.<br><br>

  Anyone who's trying to implement an online multiplayer
  feature with Unity should definitely check out Photon. It's a great tool to use.
