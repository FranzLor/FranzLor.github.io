    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        FPSFrenzy has been a cornerstone for my journey so far. <br><br>

        One, this project was my first time developing a first-person shooter.
        Second, this was also my first time implementing online networking into a game.
        For such big feats, this was a pretty difficult project to tackle. But I'm proud of what I've accomplished.<br><br>

        At first, the idea was to create a simple first-person shooter, with low poly textures, shooting at AI.
        However, I wanted to go bigger since I've worked on AI already. So I decided to implement an online multiplayer feature.<br><br>

        Players can join a lobby and play against each other. Initially, for 1v1-type scenarios.
        Each player can choose between 3 weapons: a pistol, a submachine gun, and a sniper rifle.
        A player wins by getting the most amount of kills before the timer runs out. <br><br>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <h4>Online Networking</h4>
    <p>
        FPSFrenzy was my first real dive into online multiplayer,
        and let me tell you it was equally rewarding and frustrating.<br><br>

        For this project, I worked with Photon, a networking tool that’s pretty
        beginner-friendly but still packed with complexities when it comes to real-time multiplayer.
        From synchronizing player movements to managing game states,
        Photon helped me handle a lot of the heavy lifting,
        but it still required plenty of fine-tuning to get things just right.<br><br>

        One of the biggest challenges was syncing animations and player movement across the network.
        <strong>It’s not just about sending data; it’s about sending the right data at the right time</strong>.<br><br>

        For example, player positions needed frequent updates to look smooth for other players,
        but not so frequent that it bogged down the network.
        I spent hours tweaking this balance and designing a protocol to prioritize critical actions
        like shooting, jumping, or switching weapons, while cutting back on non-essential updates.<br><br>

        Another tricky part was making sure all players saw the same UI elements
        in real time—like scores, timers, and lobby data.
        Even something as simple as displaying a player’s name or a server title involved precise timing.
        The solution?
        I carefully structured when and how this data was sent:
        typically when a match started, a player joined, or a significant event occurred.
        It sounds simple, but ensuring all players saw the same
        thing without delays was a constant test of patience and attention to detail.<br><br>

        Implementing these systems taught me a lot about the complexities of real-time networking
        and the importance of optimizing data flow to maintain a seamless multiplayer experience.
        Photon’s tools were incredibly helpful for these tasks,
        but the process also emphasized the need for custom solutions
        tailored to specific game mechanics and player expectations.<br><br>

        Anyone who's trying to implement an online multiplayer
        feature with Unity should definitely check out Photon. It's a great tool to use.
